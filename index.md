# About Me and the DATA 441 Repository


## Me

I am Steven Jia a senior majoring in Computer Science and Data Science.  I only declared my Data Science major last year so I am trying to maximize the variety of data science courses I am taking in the one year I had before graduating. Most of my experience has been learning fundamentals about regressions, modeling, and visualizations. Last semester I conducted an analysis of NFL player characteristics which can be found here: https://spuriussergius.github.io/DATA303-Interacting-With-Data/. Beyond that I have also done an assignment derived from Netflix's movie recommendation algorithm challenge and this semester I will have multiple final projects in my data science courses which I hope to talk more about once I solidify their concepts.

In terms of research, I have not had the time to really explore the data science field. Most of my time has been spent making up for lost time due to how late I decided to add the data science major. However, I am taking classes in NLP, time series analysis, and operations research. This is all part of my attempt to get a broad look at data science topics. Of course, DATA 441 is also part of this effort and I am looking forward to learning new techniques to enhance my analysis skills.

## The Repository

Here I will explain how files are organized

### HW1

This is the folder for homework 1 where we were tasked with implmenting ridge regression with PyTorch and completing the exercise in the "Application to Locally Weighted Regression" Jupyter notebook.

### HW2

Homework 2 contains a gradient boost implementation with a test of the implementation with different types of scalers and a K-nearest neighbors classification implementation.

### HW3

Homework 3 contains a SCAD regularization implementation in a PyTorch class and a test of SCAD, ElasticNet, and SqrtLasso feature selection methods to see which can approximate closest to the ideal solution.
